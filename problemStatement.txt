Problem Statement:
When deciding on a restaurant with a group, it can be difficult to
find a food type, restaurant atmosphere, and price to fit everyone.

Solution:
In order to fairly decide upon a place to eat each user is allocated a
beginning amount of decision points. These decision points can be allocated
to a number of different categories. The points are equal and finite per-user
so that their overall decision weight can be allocated to the area they 
care about the most or distributed evenly amongst their preferences.
